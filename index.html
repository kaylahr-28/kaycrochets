            <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
            <h3>Progress is never linear!</h3>
            <p>It all started my sophomore year of high school. Fresh out of quarantine, I decided to join Fiber Arts
                Club-
                I loved creating things with my hands and I had never tried to crochet before. My friend also joined,
                but they
                already had some experience with crocheting. So, I asked them to help me learn. The crochet hook felt so
                unnatural
                in my hand. My first attempts to create something of substance consisted of awkward hand movements and
                plenty of
                wrist pain. Not to mention I was a lefty trying to learn from a righty's perspective, so I had to mirror
                all of my friend's movements in my head. Eventually,
                though, I had a basic idea of how to make a chain stitch, the foundation of many crochet
                projects... Then,
                I didn't crochet for a year and I forgot it all. The truth is I had been practicing different stitches
                with yarn provided by the
                club, but when I decided to undo all my work, the yarn got very tangled, so I spent the rest of the
                school year trying to untangle it.
                That's besides the point, though. I started crocheting again at the start of junior year, where I made
                my first
                <i>actual</i> project- a beanie! Since then, I've grown much more comfortable crocheting. I joined the
                Fiber
                Arts Club E-Board my senior year, and after high school I have continued to crochet throughout college.
                I still struggle with things like tension and gauge, but every project is a learning experience!

            <h3 id="whatabknit">WHAT ABOUT KNITTING?</h3>
            <p>I also learned how to knit in my senior year of high school, and I can definitely see the appeal. It uses
                less
                yarn and
                90% of projects are based on two types of stitches, making it easy to comprehend. However, I've not
                yet
                reached the point of comfortability where I can knit things without a pattern. I find it hard to
                customize
                knitting because it seems to follow such a specific pattern, in terms of where you start and end
                stitches. With
                crocheting though, I have much more freedom. I can stick my hook into any part of the project and just
                start
                building chains off of it, if I wanted to. I think there's so much more potential for creativity in
                crochet projects.

                            of these
                            by now, but
                            this is the most recent one I've made and I really
                            like it! I made it for a concert with a black-and-red theme. I customized it by adding extra
                            details
                            to
                            the original pattern, like the ruffles at the wrists and the star in the center.

            <h2>What is the Best Yarn to Use?</h2>

            <p>Well, that depends. The most common yarn to use is weight 4 acrylic. This is the standard for most
                basic crochet projects. Cotton is also popular, typically for lightweight clothing. These are the
                two that I normally use. I also like using chenille yarn, especially for amigurumi projects, because
                the material is softer and it also gives the figures a softer look. If you want to be
                fancy, you could try blended yarns made of two or more materials. I used a wool-acrylic yarn blend for
                a scarf once and it is very cozy! Not only should you consider material, you should also take weight, or
                thickness, into account. Weight 4 is the standard, but you could try bulkier yarns (weight 5 and above)
                or
                thinner ones (3 and under) to spice up your project! Bulky yarn is best for bigger projects because it
                works
                up much faster. Thin yarn can be tedious and cause some hand cramps, but they make your work look much
                more
                intricate. My advice would be: experiment! Find what materials amd weights are best for you. There's
                also nothing wrong with sticking with the standard- it is the cheapest option, after all.
